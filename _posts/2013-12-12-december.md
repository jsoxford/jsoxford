<p class="lead">Join us for the last meetup of 2013 where we'll be talking about using streams in node and chattting about some new JS Projects</p>

## Indestructible twitter streams with node
### by [Ben](http://benjaminbenben.com) <small><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=benjaminbenben">@benjaminbenben</a></small>

> The twitter streaming apis are totally fun and super awesome.
> 
> I'll cover the (surprisingly detailed) data that we can get from the streams, and some of the challenges that we have to face to maintain a connection.
> 
> We'll delve into the node stream API - and how we can use this to abstract a robust interface to the twitter apis that can survive network failures, stale connections and modifying query parameters.
> 
> Then we'll talk about some of the awesome projects/hacks that we can do when we are able to dynamically alter parameters.

## Bring yOur Own hYperlink Along - BOOYA
### by Everyone!

We're going to try a new type of session, bring a few links to js-based projects that you find interesting and we'll go through them and have a quick chat.

It doesn't matter if you don't know anything about the project, just anything that you find interesting or cool!

### hYperlink we discussed

#### [Nodecopter](http://nodecopter.com/) _via [@chvck](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=chvck)_

> Nodecopters are cool

#### [Calculating element vertex data from CSS transforms](http://blog.keithclark.co.uk/calculating-element-vertex-data-from-css-transforms/) _via [@benjaminbenben](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=benjaminbenben)_

> When you want to do complex calculations based on the transforms of elements, you might be better using webGL (counter argument: have you used webGL?)

#### [Stop Being Cute and Clever](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/12/9/stop-being-clever/) _via [@ghickman](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=ghickman)_

> Went over why `[1,2,3].map(parseInt)` evaluates to `[1, NaN, NaN]`, talked about dependency management for other languages and how projects like [rails-assets](https://rails-assets.org/) can allow cross dependency integration. Touched briefly on PHP.

#### [jQuery matchers and fixture loader for Jasmine framework](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery) _via [@floehopper](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=floehopper)_

> None of us actively/formally use fixtures in our JS projects.

#### [Every javascript project you should be looking into](http://www.javascriptoo.com/) _via [@jopotts](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jopotts)_

> We liked how the library examples load in the same site and wondered if the projects were ordered by reverse popularity. [@jopotts](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jopotts) said he would have chosen [this link](http://ejohn.org/blog/node-js-stream-playground/) if he'd actually thought about it.
