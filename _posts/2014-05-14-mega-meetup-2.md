## Getting functional with Clojurescript

### by [Matthew Thompson](http://mthompson.org) <small><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=cblop">@cblop</a></small>

> Clojurescript is a dialect of lisp that compiles to Javascript. In this talk, we will go about making a basic game from scratch. Along the way, we’ll learn about setting up Clojurescript projects, using the Light Table IDE and how to design a game using immutable data structures. I’ll also explain why Clojurescript is useful for front-end web development.
