===================

This is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) site - run it locally with `jekyll --server --auto`.

If you change the style.less - you'll need to install less - `npm install -g less` and generate the css with `lessc assets/style.less > assets/style.css`.  More info at the [lesscss site](http://lesscss.org/)

The site is built with github pages - stuff about that [here](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles).

If you don't have write access make a pull request to master and maybe poke someone to accept it.

Content stuff
-------------

We link to @jsoxford with [twitter intents](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents), so maybe you can use that too? Or not I guess.
