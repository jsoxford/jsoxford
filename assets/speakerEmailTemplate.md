The doors officially open at 6:45pm with the talks starting at 7:20pm. Talks are usually all finished between 9:15pm, but people usually head to a local pub afterwards. We'll be around from 6.30pm if you need more time to set up.

## Set up
There is a 1080p monitor for us to use. If you need sound for your presentation please let us know so we can get this set up prior.

## Filming

We would like to film all the talks held at JSOxford however we understand this is not always possible.

Please do let us know if you would not like your talk to be filmed.

If you donâ€™t mind us recording your talk then we'll record both the output from your screen as well as yourself. This allows us to capture live coding and similar as well as anything you want to point at etc.
We will release the videos under a creative commons license so you will be free to use the recordings produced for any purpose you wish. All videos will be uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjXR8G5M-iwkHVF26AFFsCQ) and shared with you to give your approval before we publish it to the public.
