<p class="lead">This month we heard about TiddlyWiki and had a couple of impromptu demos <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/jsoxford-march/">- lanyrd</a></p>


* [Jeremy Ruston](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jermolene) gave us a fantastic overview TiddlyWiki and his 25 year reboot project [TiddlyWiki5](http://five.tiddlywiki.com).
* John told us about kinetic text and how he's been building a demo with html/css/js.
* [Pete](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=peterjwest) told us about the hack day and our progress of building a node.js [library](https://github.com/jsoxford/node-wirc) for controlling [Dension Smart Racers](http://www.wirc.dension.com/smartracer).
