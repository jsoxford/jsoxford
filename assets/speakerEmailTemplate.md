Set up
The screen resolution at the venue is 1920*1080. If you need sound for your presentation please do let us know so we can get this set up prior.
There is also internet at the venue however it is not that reliable. 

Filming
We would like to film all the talks held at JSOxford however we understand this is not always possible. Please do let us know if you would not like your talk to be filmed. 
If you donâ€™t mind us recording you we'll be recording you - the speaker and screen output so that any live coding stuff will be fine.


The doors officially open at 19.00 with the talks starting at 19.20. Talks are usually all finished between 21.00 - 21.15, but people usually head to a local pub afterward. We'll be around from 18.30 if you need more time to set up.

I hope you find this helpful and please let me know if you have any questions. We look forward to seeing you on the 17th.

Thank you,
