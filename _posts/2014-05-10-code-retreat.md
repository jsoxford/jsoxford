## We're very excited to be part of [JavaScript&nbsp;CodeRetreat](http://jscoderetreat.com/2/)

<div class="well" id="hello-attendees">
  <h3>Thanks for making it a success!</h3>
  <p>The first Oxford JS code retreat went really well in spite of a very early start. Pastries, coffee and burritos flowed, and we had some good discussions in the retrospectives and afterwards in the pub.</p>
  <p>Here are a few links from the day:

      <li><a href="http://jscoderetreat.com/2/">The session list</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://tddbin.com">TDDBin</a></li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>We're really excited about the possibility for variations of the code retreat theme, in particular:
  <ul>
      <li>Mixing up Python, Ruby &amp; Javascript developers for a cultural exchange</li>
      <li>Focus on levelling-up JS: less focus on TDD, instead constrain the approach differently for each session to use 'the best bits' of JS</li>
      <li>Focus on functional programming</li>
  </ul>
  If you're excited too or have ideas for how we could make it better, let us know!

<p class="lead">Write better code, eat better food&hellip; The JavaScript code retreat is a chance to hone your programming skills without the pressure of Getting Things Done.</p>

The [JS Code Retreat](http://jscoderetreat.com/2/) is a day of pair-programming around a common programming challenge. Over 5 to 6 45-minute programming sessions you'll get to work with a variety of people and work on improving your day-to-day coding, whether it's TDD, DRY, naming, or whatever. At the end of each session we'll regroup and share what we've learned.

For a nice introduction to code retreat and why it's a great idea, [check out this video](http://player.vimeo.com/video/18955165?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0).

### What do I need to bring?

Just your good self and a laptop. If you've got a ready-to-go environment all the better, but if not we'd recommend [TDDBin](http://www.tddbin.com/).

We'll provide drinks and lunch!

### How much does it cost?

We take payment in fun, effort and brainpower. There is no entry fee, you just need to a [RSVP on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat/attendees/).

### Where?

We'll be meeting at [White October](http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/) to kick off coding at 8.30AM. Although that's pretty early for a Saturday, we're sychronising with groups from Cologne, Munich and Barcelona (so far). The upside is that it's early enough for pastries!

All we ask is that if you can't make it you <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat/attendees/">update your RSVP</a> so we can get that space to someone else.

### That sounds great, how can I help?

At the moment we'd be really grateful for:

* **Sponsorship!** Help us provide codefuel to keep the creative juices flowing.
* **Help on the day.** There's plenty of setting up and clearing down, as well as keeping the day running smoothly. Get in touch if you're keen to help out.
* **Spread the word.** Most important of all, shout it from the rooftops (or just use Twitter&hellip;).


### Other things

[Haybrook IT Resourcing](http://www.haybrook.co.uk/) have kindly sponsored breakfast pastries and lunch. Be sure to chat to Sarah over coffee before the event and say how great the food is!
We also have a JetBrains WebStorm license to give away - we'll pick a winner from the attendees on the day.

As if that wasn't enough, we've got a number of 10% discount codes for the [JSDay conference in Verona](http://2014.jsday.it/).
