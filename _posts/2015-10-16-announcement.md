## New location

Starting next month we will be moving to a new location - [The Story Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/u6pfRTxWzg12) - to handle our ever-growing community of JavaScript loving friends!

## Social meetups

Starting in the new year we plan to run some social meetups where people can get to gether in a coffee shop or similar and work together on side projects or get help with talk preperation etc. We're hoping this turns into a beautiful organic thing.
