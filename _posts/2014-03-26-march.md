### And we're back! &hellip;on a TUESDAY!?!

<p class="lead">This month we're talking about getting our code running in the real world. Come along to find out how to deploy apps with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a> and how continuous deployment can help you build software faster and with less stress.</p>

## Node + Heroku + Unrealistic time constraints

### with Pete West <small><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=peterjwest">@peterjwest</a></small>

> Can you build and deploy a site in 5 minutes from scratch?

> May well be a codetastrophe, heckling encouraged!

_Pete did a great job of deploying [jsox.herokuapp.com](http://jsox.herokuapp.com/) in (slightly over) 10 minutes.  He covered [github](http://github.com), [npm](https://npmjs.org), [express](http://expressjs.com/), [jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [bower](http://bower.io/) &amp; [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)._

    <h2>Bring yOur Own hYperlink Along</h2>
    <h3>with Everyone!</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This worked pretty well last time, so we'll do it again!</p>
        <p>We all bring a link to js-based project/post/anything that you find interesting and we'll have a quick chat about it.</p>

### We've cancelled BOOYA because there's a [GITHUB DRINKUP IN TOWN](https://github.com/blog/1809-github-drinkup-in-oxford-uk)&hellip;

&hellip;If we start promptly at 7.30, and hold Pete to his unrealistic time constraints. We'll have plenty of time to make it across town for the drink up.

Also, if this is the first you've heard about the drink up; you totally need to come along with us - it's the polite thing to do! (and, it's the [rules](/rules.html))

As usual, we'll be meeting at [White October](http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/) at 7.30PM - we'd appreciate if you [attend on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-march) (it lets us know how many drinks and snacks to get in!).
