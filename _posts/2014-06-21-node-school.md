# This event has finished, see the [summer of hacks](http://jsoxford.com/2014/summer-of-hacks/) post for information about the next events

<p class="lead"><a href="http://nodeschool.io/">NodeSchool</a> is a community driven, open source educational project that teaches JavaScript and node.js skills in an interactive, self-guided way.</p>

Register and attend if you want to meet up at the Jam Factory and dive into a nodeschool workshop. There are workshops available for every skill level from JS beginners all the way to experienced node programmers.

You will need to bring your own laptop, and it will help if you have already installed [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Mentors will help you on the day.
