   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR RYAN AND PETE, I THINK WE SHOULD GET TALK DESCRIPTIONS BEFORE WE ANNOUNCE THIS.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time Javascript didn't exist, then for a relatively short time it was only in browsers, but now it's, like, &lt;b&gt;everywhere&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to talk about some of the places that javascript is, that aren't a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electron&lt;/b&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/disciplex&quot;&gt;Richard Patching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;TBA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating &amp;amp; Publishing Your First Node Module (In 10 Minutes) –&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richdevans&quot;&gt;Rich Evans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to level up with the Javascript Adventure Club? In this pulse-pounding demonstration of vi-rtuosity, a humble lumbercoder armed only with a copy of vim will test, develop, and publish a sweet module to npm in only 10 minutes. Your ticket to glory and riches is only an 'npm publish' away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• #amazing 🐙  – Agnes from Hull&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• I learned a lot! – Bill from Oxford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ – Jambo79 from Stretford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TBA&lt;/b&gt; – TBA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors open 7:00pm, talks start at 7:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(the post summer talk/drink/party meet up rocket potato)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer has been pretty great; not just (mostly) the weather, but our hack events, evening meetups and p.a.r.t.ies have been all been great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meetup is going to be great, and also things after that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got three great talks lined up for September, come along to hear about…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;





&lt;b&gt;📢  Digital Manuscript Toolkit – the journey so far – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/monicams&quot;&gt;Monica Messaggi Kaya&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[cancelled] Unfortunately Monica is unable to attend JSOxford tonight; she'll be giving this talk at a later date.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An introduction to International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and its use on the Digital Manuscript Toolkit (DMT) - where Monica is working specifically on a JavaScript client to edit manuscripts online (via browser).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;📢  Visualising runkeeper data with html5 apis – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben&quot;&gt;Ben Foxall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben will take us through some features of the web platform that allow us to retreive, process, and visualise data he's collected runkeeper. We'll cover stuff like service workers, indexeddb, canvas, d3, webgl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;📢  Making the web more better – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jreeve0&quot;&gt;Joe Reeve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe works at SquaredUp(.com) using Ractive to build dashboards and improve system administrator's workflows, and he's going to be showing us how we can use Ractive to fix the way we web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;b&gt; 📢  Unfolding the Future of Javascript – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/henrahmagix&quot;&gt;Henry Blyth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry will have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/henrahmagix/status/641712731087892480&quot;&gt;4 minutes and 25 seconds&lt;/a&gt; to tell us some things about Javascript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;📢  The what, why and how of ClojureScript – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ivanbokii&quot;&gt;Ivan Bokii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan will tell us how ClojureScript is different from other, more conventional, programming languages and what concepts and features this modern version of LISP has that can help you as a front-end developer to do your job better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;





We've got some time for micro-pitches after the talks, so if you've got a job, project or interesting thing to share with the group that's your chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have drinks and snacks (kindly provided by Haybrook) and plenty of people with interesting ideas, so come early and stay late! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can stick around later, you should.  We'll be heading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/starpuboxford&quot;&gt;the Star&lt;/a&gt; for some drinks and chat after the meetup.  We'll hopefully end up there by 9.30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🍹🎉&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2015/JSOxHack</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The JSOxHack is a full-day hack event to play with the technologies we've learned over summer, or anything else that interests us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a hackathon or competition, and there are no prizes. Instead it's a chance to hack with great people on interesting things. We'll start the day with a round of pitches, so if you've got any ideas bring them along. If you're just keen to take part there will be plenty of groups, and we've got mentors around all day to guide and support you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day anyone who'd like to can show and tell before we wrap up and head to Jo Perks for an evening of conversation and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who should come?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone! If you can write a bit of JavaScript you'll fit right in. We'll have plenty of mentors to help and guide you throughout the day, and the aim of the event is to have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do I need to bring?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you'll need is your own laptop (if you don't have one, just get in touch with us in advance and we'll do our best to sort you out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any leftovers from a previous event, components, devices or things you'd like to hack on, bring them along!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>RailsBridge</title>
   <link href="http://jsoxford.com/2015/RailsBridge/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-08T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2015/RailsBridge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;RailsBridge workshops are a free and fun way to get started or level up with Rails, Ruby, and other web technologies. Our events focus on increasing diversity in tech, so that people of all backgrounds can feel welcome and comfortable in our industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are interested in learning how to build interactive websites. &lt;b&gt;Attendees should identify as a woman, and can bring a guest of any gender.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in learning how to program? Never written a line of code before and are a little intimidated by nerds? There's no need to be! RailsBridge is a friendly place to get together and learn how to write some code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you've written a little HTML and CSS before, or touched on Ruby or programming. Maybe you're completely new to this and ready for a challenge. All you need to attend is a laptop* and enthusiasm (*get in touch if you can't get hold of a laptop and we'll see what we can do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have some of the amazing people from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.new-bamboo.co.uk/&quot;&gt;New Bamboo&lt;/a&gt; on hand alongside the JSOxford and OxRUG volunteers, so there's plenty of help and mentorship available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have tea, coffee, snacks and drinks available throughout the day, as well as pastries in the morning and burritos for lunch. Please get in touch if you have any special dietary requirements and we'll sort you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two tracks: &lt;b&gt;Frontend&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/b&gt;. Programmers of all skill levels are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ruby on Rails track&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this track we'll take you through building a complete web application using Ruby on Rails. By the end of the day, you'll have an application that connects to a database and reads and writes information. Even better, it'll be on the internet! You can see the activities for this track &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Don't forget to come to the Friday InstallFest (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frontend track&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frontend track is all about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We'll be building webpages, making them look *amazing*, and adding dynamic behaviour using JavaScript (click &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.railsbridge.org/frontend/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the course syllabus) The only thing you need for this track is a text editor and the web browser you already use! Please download and install a programming text editor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/3&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; are a good choice). Don't forget to come to the Friday InstallFest (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friday evening InstallFest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to learn on Saturday, so it would be really helpful if everyone is set-up and ready to go. We'll meet up on Friday evening to install all of the software you need (or work through any problems you've had installing), and then spend Saturday learning and writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can run through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/&quot;&gt;InstallFest&lt;/a&gt; steps prior to attending that's also great. Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need. Bandwidth will be at a premium during the day, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sponsors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We're very grateful to our sponsors for helping to make this event happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haybrook.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Haybrook IT&lt;/a&gt;, for providing lunchtime burritos, snacks and refreshments.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NodeBots Writeup</title>
   <link href="http://jsoxford.com/2015/nodebots-writeup/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2015/nodebots-writeup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last saturday saw International Nodebots Day, and another &lt;a href=&quot;http://summerofhacks.io&quot;&gt;Summer of Hacks&lt;/a&gt; event from JSOxford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guys put together a great event in partnership with Gordon from Pur3.
Gordon is the talented inventor of the Espurino family of javascript powered microcontrollers and had previously given a talk to the group about the boards, so most people were already juiced up to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Nodebots-table-of-stuff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Table of stuff&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A heap of wires, batteries, servos and other electronics had been duly arranged and Gordon had even gone to the supreme effort of developing a printed circuit board to form the chassis of the mobile robot
and had instructions prepared to give us a head start of assembling our soon-to-be planet destroying synthetic lifeform underlings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivation to begin soldering was high and one could feel the anticipation of the day’s creativity in the air, and as the crumbs of french pastries still lingered on moustaches, the hardware hacking fury began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surges of caffeine countered with the absolute need of a steady hand for soldering surface mount components onto the board but the group tore through the hardware assembly eager to get to promised land of embedded Javascript control of their new robotic creations.
Early finishers eased out of hardware assembly and hit the whiteboards to sketch out the software needed for world domination via robots equipped with light sensors and servos for forward and backward motion and possibly a bluetooth transceiver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Nodebots-hard-at-work.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hard at work on NodeBots&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As delicious as the Burritos were, lunch was a mere footnote of the day as teams inhaled the mexican food, quaffed a beer and rushed back to the lab to focus on the hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid afternoon saw a flurry of creations being given the spark of life in the modern-day primordial soup of burrito-stained wiring, hot glue residue and embedded Javascript and an veritable army of imposing artificial beings were sent forth to spin arbitrarily and crash into skirting boards as their human overlords scratched their beards and contemplated the bewildering complexity of providing motion through esoteric pulse width modulation schemes expressed in javascript functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Nodebots-spin.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Spinning Bot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, designs were iterated and robotic displays such as “light following” plus the odd whiteboard “what could have been” presentations were duly impressed upon the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Job well done! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WalkIntoTheLight?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WalkIntoTheLight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MothBot?src=hash&quot;&gt;#MothBot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NodeBots?src=hash&quot;&gt;#NodeBots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JSOxford&quot;&gt;@JSOxford&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/w0F93Xiv17&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/w0F93Xiv17&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&amp;mdash; Dan Pope (@danielthepope) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danielthepope/status/624969982934392832&quot;&gt;July 25, 2015&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the afternoon the focus wore off and content in their creations, the crowd of hackers hit the fortunately still-functioning kill-switch on their robotic creations in favour of pitchers of iced pineapple dacquiries, and other beverages befitting the new masters of a robot army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As (whatever is in a dacquiri) took hold, conversations were held with decreasing amounts of sense, and an astonishingly diverse range of concepts were debated such as inappropriate handshake techniques and the use of potatoes in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue the moonwalking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brilliant day of hacking was had thanks to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gordon from Pur3 Ltd for the extra hardware designs and blueprints&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White October for the venue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pusher for the electronic components&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Haybrook IT Recruitment for the Pastries, Burritos and Snackage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and the guys at JSOxford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other people wrote about the day too:&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2015/NodeBots-Day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NodeBots are robots that are controlled by JavaScript. Come along for a day of hardware and software hacking, where &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; get to control the machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/espruino&quot;&gt;Gordon Williams&lt;/a&gt; will be joining us with a host of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espruino.com/&quot;&gt;Espruino&lt;/a&gt; boards, components and wizardry. We also have a couple of node-powered RC cars, some Arduino Uno boards and a collection of components, as well as a few boxes of Lego Technic to let your imagination run wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is part of the International NodeBots Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who should come?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone! If you can write a bit of JavaScript you'll fit right in. If you know a little about electronics or Arduino then all the better, but it's not required. We'll have plenty of mentors to help and guide you throughout the day, and you've got the opportunity to hack on your own projects, play with some of the kit, or even just join a group and see what the day brings. The focus of NodeBots day is sharing and enjoying each others company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do I need to bring?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you'll need is your own laptop (if you don't have one, just get in touch with us in advance and we'll do our best to sort you out), and it will help if nodejs is already installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any components, devices or things you'd like to hack on &lt;b&gt;bring them along!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have tea, coffee, snacks and drinks available throughout the day, as well as pastries in the morning and burritos for lunch. Please get in touch if you have any special dietary requirements and we'll sort you out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who do I thank?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly Ryan, totally Gordon and kind of Ben for organising the day, buying stuff, and being great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pusher.com&quot;&gt;Pusher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;- paid for the robot parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/f/9/600_440113817.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haybrook.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Haybrook&lt;/a&gt; - bought us snacks, drinks &amp;amp; burritos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/2/5/c/600_439032892.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espruino.com/&quot;&gt;Espruino&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;- Gordon provided the espruinos, both today and in general&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;IT’S. SO. SUMMERY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’re probably reading this in the park right now, which is totally great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got three awesome talks that are &lt;b&gt;definitely&lt;/b&gt; worth coming inside for (also, we’ll have some beers/juice so you can cool off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rumyra&quot;&gt;Ruth John&lt;/a&gt; - A Journey Through Web API Space &amp;amp; Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;More browser APIs seem to be cropping up daily, it’s hard to keep track of what’s what and which is which. Don’t panic, Ruth takes us on a tour of what’s past, what’s present and what the future holds, so you can level up and feel a lot calmer about what’s on the event horizon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ninjanails&quot;&gt;Seren Davies&lt;/a&gt; - Death to Icon Fonts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you use icon fonts? Are you aware of their shortcomings? In this talk Seren will highlight some of the downsides with using icon fonts and show you an alternative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/omgmog&quot;&gt;Max Glenister&lt;/a&gt; - A running start at Google Cardboard with JavaScript&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This talk will not contain any actual running)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Espruino&quot;&gt;Gordon Williams&lt;/a&gt; - JavaScript for things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Controlling the real world with JavaScript and Espruino Pico. Gordon will show you how - and why - it's more fun to develop embedded software with JavaScript than C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2015/Practical-Open-Linked-Data-Mega-Meetup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month we're having a super-mega-meetup with &lt;a href=&quot;http://oxrug.org/&quot;&gt;OxRUG&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/oxfordpython/&quot;&gt;Oxford Python Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt; to look at open data and how we can leverage and contribute to global datasets. Open data is great in theory, but how can we go about &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; using it, and what are the practical implications? Hopefully we'll find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Practical Open and Linked Data - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ldodds&quot;&gt;Leigh Dodds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leigh Dodds from the Open Data Institute will talk us through real-world open and linked data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TBA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the talks we'll host a discussion on the practicalities of open data, so bring along stories of success, failure, glory and pain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, we've got some time for micro-pitches before we break out for drinks and discussion, so if you've got a job, project or interesting thing to share with the group that's your chance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NodeSchool Writeup</title>
   <link href="http://jsoxford.com/2015/nodeschool-writeup/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2015/nodeschool-writeup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“First learn stand, then learn fly. Nature rule, Daniel-san, not mine.”&lt;/em&gt; — Mr. Miyagi, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/&quot;&gt;The Karate Kid&lt;/a&gt; (1984)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday 23rd of May was &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeschool.io/international-day/&quot;&gt;International NodeSchool Day&lt;/a&gt;, with workshops focused on grokking &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; taking place all over the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canny bods at &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsoxford.com/&quot;&gt;JSOxford&lt;/a&gt; were running an event locally at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/&quot;&gt;White October’s&lt;/a&gt; offices in Oxford’s hip Cowley suburb as part of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://summerofhacks.io/&quot;&gt;Summer of Hacks&lt;/a&gt; programme. Intrigued by the thought of spending a day immersed in NodeJS, I duly sauntered along in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm&quot;&gt;Vibram’s&lt;/a&gt; to see what was cooking in their Node kitchen. I’m glad I did because the day was proper station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Station!”&lt;/em&gt; — Ted, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101452/&quot;&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Ted’s Bogus Journey&lt;/a&gt; (1991)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-morning&quot;&gt;The Morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was structured such that the first half was spent working through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.github.com/workshopper/learnyounode&quot;&gt;learnyounode&lt;/a&gt; workshop. This workshop is introductory Node material, covering topics such as asynchronous IO and the module system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nodeschool-learnyounode-workshow.png&quot; alt=&quot;learnyounode workshop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This material is good and presented well via a lovely command line application. I’d recommend it to my colleagues to bootstrap their Node learning. Some of the error messages were a tad cryptic, but that’s easily addressed: one of the attendees even took the time to submit a Pull Request to improve the error message in one of the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I didn’t get much from the material having already covered the content in my earlier explorations of NodeJS. It was good to structure the day this way though, because more experienced folk were thus pushed to pair with less experienced folk and there was plenty of knowledge-sharing and conversation which made me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-afternoon&quot;&gt;The Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the day was devoted to “electives”: material that covered a specific area of NodeJS to an intermediate level. (Promises, Express, Working With Binary Data, that sort of thing.). Folk were encouraged to pick an elective that interested them, and they could then either pair with like-minded folk or strike out on their own. If folk wanted to continue with the &lt;code&gt;learnyounode&lt;/code&gt; module they could do that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dipped in and out of a few electives, sampling them and getting a feel for ones that I’ll work through on my own time later. The Functional Elective isn’t particularly NodeJS-focused – being more of a general ES5 elective – but Ryan and I had a fun few minutes working through the trampolining exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked that folk could investigate areas of NodeJS that appealed to them. The (slight) downside is that folk fragmented into isolated clusters and a little of the collaborative pair programming vibe was lost. I spent some of the afternoon wandering around asking folk about what they were working on and offering help where I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was a definite “post burrito” slump after lunch :laughing: Thanks for the awesome lunch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haybrook.co.uk/&quot;&gt;HaybrookIT&lt;/a&gt;, you rock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-evening&quot;&gt;The Evening&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we retired the the pub for some drinks and fine banter. What happened at the pub stays at the pub though, so I will speak no more of it here save to mention that there was krumping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-wanted-from-the-day&quot;&gt;What I Wanted From The Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; stack in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/netrunner/android-netrunner-card-spoilers/_/order-and-chaos/day-job-r622&quot;&gt;day job&lt;/a&gt; and the recent release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; has opened the door to using NodeJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to spend the day knee deep in the mud of NodeJS: I wanted to wiggle my toes deep in the cool muck and get a good feel for the Node ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-got-from-the-day&quot;&gt;What I Got From The Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent ~6 hours immersed in NodeJS via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers&quot;&gt;excellent material&lt;/a&gt; provided by the NodeSchool website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to know about a great resource for bootstrapping the folk on my team into NodeJS. I also learned about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay&quot;&gt;cowsay&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, I got to enjoy the company of some great folk that I already know, and got to meet some new folk on the JSOxford scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Ryan and Ben from JSOxford for organising the day, to Sarah from HaybrookIT for sponsoring the event, to the NodeSchool community for providing such sweet resource, and to the folk that attended on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shout out to Adam for his stirring singalong of The Rains of Castamere. #awesome&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Lesson not just karate only. Lesson for whole life. Whole life have a balance.”&lt;/em&gt; — Mr. Miyagi, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/&quot;&gt;The Karate Kid&lt;/a&gt; (1984)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>JSOxford For Newbies</title>
   <link href="http://jsoxford.com/2015/jsoxford-for-newbies/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2015/jsoxford-for-newbies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danielthepope&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt;. I studied Computer Science at the University of Bath where I learned absolutely no JavaScript whatsoever. When I was working on placement, I used jQuery to show and hide elements on a webpage, and that was it. Not exactly what you’d call sophisticated JavaScript is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all I knew when I first joined JSOxford about a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first events I attended was &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodebots.io/&quot;&gt;NodeBots&lt;/a&gt;, where I stuck some wires together and ended up with an Arduino that could &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/danielthepope/status/503219737527336960/photo/1&quot;&gt;tell me the temperature&lt;/a&gt;. Fast-forward a few months to the Realtime hack day, where I made a webpage which sends colours to everyone connected (&lt;a href=&quot;https://danielthepope.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/realtime-hacking-with-jsoxford/&quot;&gt;Writeup here&lt;/a&gt;). I still feel like a beginner at every event I attend, but I really enjoy them and I’m keen to learn more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what your skill level is, you’re welcome to join us at any of our events. The hack days in particular are very beginner-friendly, where the main aim is to have fun. There’s always someone willing to teach the basics and get you started. Alternatively, if you know what you’re doing, you can just get on with what you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re always on the lookout for new members. If you haven’t been to a hack day before, our &lt;a href=&quot;http://summerofhacks.io&quot;&gt;Summer of Hacks&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect place to get started. Learn, improve or perfect your JavaScript skills, and there’s free food, drink and stickers. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're going to have a hack day centred around realtime web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be a day long event - with tonnes of opportunity to learn about, and hack with, technologies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/WebSockets&quot;&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/&quot;&gt;Server Sent Events&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webrtc.org/&quot;&gt;WebRTC&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details to come, but it's going to be &lt;b&gt;awesome&lt;/b&gt;. (There might even be some stickers!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Space is limited&lt;/b&gt; - so you &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; be signed up here to attend. (Also, only sign up if you're sure you can attend!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schedule&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.30 - &lt;/b&gt;start (pastries &amp;amp; coffee)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.40 - &lt;/b&gt;hello, overview of data / tools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;10.00 - &lt;/b&gt;project pitching / choosing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;10.30 - &lt;/b&gt;kick off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;12.45 - &lt;/b&gt;retrospectives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.00 - &lt;/b&gt;lunch (🌟  &lt;a href=&quot;http://missionburrito.co.uk/&quot;&gt;burritos&lt;/a&gt; 🌟)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.30 - &lt;/b&gt;show &amp;amp; tell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.30 - &lt;/b&gt;recovery drinks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeperksandco.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Joe Perks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to bring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll be good to have a laptop with node/io.js installed. Any other web-connected devices (phones/tablets/raspberryPis) might be fun too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll provide you with some sample code to get you up and running with some realtime apis/libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any particular ideas that you'd like to work on - have a think, and be ready to pitch it (max 60s); we'll be selecting a few ideas and working in teams throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll also have stickers(!!), pitches, and lots of lovely chats - hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improving Web performance Using Grunt - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Marcus_Noble_&quot;&gt;Marcus Noble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a previous talk by Andy Davies on performance I will walk through using &lt;a href=&quot;http://gruntjs.com/&quot;&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt; to improve the performance of the JS Oxford website to achieve below the target 1000 PageSpeed index. This talk will look at configuration-only approaches that can be applied without the need to change any markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playing With Trains: A Look At Open Rail Data - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neverontarget&quot;&gt;Tom Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open data is happening. Many new technologies are emerging designed specifically to aid developers in taming and handling these datasets that have been made available to them, from new database ideas (NoSQL) to visualisation libraries (D3JS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk will provide an overview of the data that has been made available from the rail industry with sources from National Rail, Network Rail and many others and the projects that have risen from it. There is a staggering amount of both quantity and depth available making for some pretty interesting possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Performance, performance &amp; testing</title>
   <link href="http://jsoxford.com/2015/Performance-performance-and-testing/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-22T19:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2015/Performance-performance-and-testing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's always a good time to care about performance, and the new year is a great opportunity to focus on building our apps responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're really excited to have Andy Davies coming to Oxford for this meetup. Andy is a web performance geek, in his day job he's Associate Director for Web Performance at NCC Group where he helps clients to measure and improve the performance of their sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote the “The Pocket Guide to Web Performance” for Five Simple Steps and is a co-author of &quot;Using WebPageTest&quot; due to be published by O'Reilly in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've also got some Oxford locals, and Tom Nickson's talk on compiling C++ into JavaScript is particularly interesting. Tom's doing a DPhil in machine learning, and has been doing some awesome things with emscripten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you've ever had to test something in a crazy way, you'll be able to relate to Ryan's talk on testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Andy Davies – Whoosh - Speed Matters!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great user experiences lead to more effective sites that have increased levels of engagement and revenue. Performance is an essential part of good user experience but all to often it get's pushed down the list of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk Andy will explore why performance matters, how we can police performance and how the fundamentals of our medium influence the speed of our sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tom Nickson – From C++ to JavaScript with Emscripten&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description coming soon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ryan Brooks – The most convoluted JavaScript testing framework?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan wants to talk about an abomination he built to test JavaScript running on the Rhino JavaScript engine, and how an optimistic &quot;of course you can test that, it's just JavaScript&quot; led to a rabbit hole and lost sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/JSOxford/members/56333062/&quot;&gt;Julian&lt;/a&gt; will present a fundamental AngularJS archetype that provides a file layout, basic project example, dependency management for your app—&lt;a href=&quot;http://bower.io/&quot;&gt;bower&lt;/a&gt;—and for developing your app—npm—, unit—&lt;a href=&quot;http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html&quot;&gt;karma&lt;/a&gt;—and integration—&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/protractor&quot;&gt;protractor&lt;/a&gt;—test configuration, basic grunt tasks, and a Continuous Integration script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julian will also share some thoughts on what to commit—and what not to commit—, release repos, knowledge libraries, and showcase some examples that prove the power of AngularJS interacting with other technologies such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;React: Rethinking Web Development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;React is a JavaScript UI library that provides a new, and possibly better, way to achieve the goal of building simple and declarative UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/JSOxford/members/137091392/&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; will explore the main design goal of React and how React changes web development for the better with some realtime examples.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2014 Summer of Hacks</title>

   <updated>2014-08-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2014/summer-of-hacks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;join-us-for-a-series-of-hands-on-events-this-summer&quot;&gt;Join us for a series of hands-on events this summer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;We're taking a break from our evening meetups for the next few months.  Instead, we're going to hold hack days, where you can come along to learn, tinker, hack &amp;amp; hang out with like minded people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got three events planned, you’ll get a lot from them whether you’re starting out, or an experienced JS developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NodeSchool&lt;/strong&gt; - get started (or better at) &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Retreat&lt;/strong&gt; - hack the way you approach coding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NodeBots&lt;/strong&gt; - JAVASCRIPT ROBOTS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See below for more information and links to register for each event.  We’ve got a limited number of tickets for each event, so sign up and put it in your diary. Tickets are £5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re really looking forward to seeing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nodeschool-small21st-june-2014small&quot;&gt;NodeSchool &lt;small&gt;21st June 2014&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NodeSchool has finished - &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/node-school/&quot;&gt;see how it went&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeschool.io/&quot;&gt;NodeSchool&lt;/a&gt; is a community driven, open source educational project that teaches JavaScript and node.js skills in an interactive, self-guided way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Register and attend if you want to meet up at the Jam Factory and dive into a nodeschool workshop. There are workshops available for every skill level from JS beginners all the way to experienced node programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to bring your own laptop, and it will help if you have already installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;. Mentors will help you on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;code-retreat-small6th-july-2014small&quot;&gt;Code Retreat &lt;small&gt;6th July 2014&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sadly the Code Retreat is over – &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/soh-code-retreat/&quot;&gt;see how it went&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Write better code to a backdrop of pastries and burritos&amp;hellip; the Code Retreat is a chance to hone your programming skills without the pressure of Getting Things Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the success of the JavaScript Code Retreat in May we’re excited to be running the 2nd Oxford Code Retreat, and this time it’s Super-Mega! Want to get hone your JavaScript, Ruby or Python? Code Retreat is for you! This time we’re shifting the focus from TDD to functional and object-oriented techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-it&quot;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Retreat is a day of pair-programming around a common challenge. Over five 45-minute sessions you’ll get to work with a variety of people to improve your day-to-day coding. At the end of each session we’ll regroup and share what we’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a nice introduction to code retreat and why it’s a great idea, &lt;a href=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/18955165?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot;&gt;check out this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nodebots-small23rd-august-2014small&quot;&gt;NodeBots &lt;small&gt;23rd August 2014&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NodeBots has now been dissassembled - write up coming soon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodebots.io/&quot;&gt;NodeBots&lt;/a&gt; are robots that are controlled by node.js. A NodeBots event is a full day event where JS developers team up in small teams to program robots with JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got 3 radio-controlled, video-enabled cars which can be controlled with JS over wifi, and also a nodecopter you can fly with JS (or just with your phone)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll have arduino kits you can use to build and program robots. You don’t need to know what a resistor is or how to use an aynschronous callback, we’ll have hardware and JS experts ready to help you throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also extra sensors and displays you can tinker with. We’ve also got buckets of Lego Technic you can use to build quick prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be able to buy Arduino kits at a discount on the day, if you want to take your work home with you (sorry you can’t buy the lego though!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sumer-of-hacks-nodebots-tickets-11906664153&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-large btn-default disabled&quot; disabled=&quot;&quot;&gt;Register for NodeBots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve moved the venue at the last minute, sorry! It will now be at the White October offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better food: we can now afford burritos and pizza for lunch, we’ll also have pastries and snacks throughout the day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlimited free tea and coffee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More space and desks, including workstations you can use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fast, reliable internet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Air conditioning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whiteboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A meeting room for serious discussion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An HD projecter for talks and demos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be collecting people from the station and the Jam Factory, so don’t worry if you don’t know the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clojurescript is a dialect of lisp that compiles to Javascript. In this talk, we will go about making a basic game from scratch. Along the way, we’ll learn about setting up Clojurescript projects, using the Light Table IDE and how to design a game using immutable data structures. I’ll also explain why Clojurescript is useful for front-end web development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” – Phil Karlton
In this talk, I will talk about naming things, telling you why is it hard to name, how to get better at naming and this will lead you to be an even better Software Developer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;events---code-retreat--node-school&quot;&gt;Events - Code Retreat &amp;amp; Node School&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=spikeheap&quot;&gt;Ryan Brooks&lt;/a&gt; will be talking about last weekends JavaScriptCodeRetreat - and how we can hold more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=roylinesuk&quot;&gt;Roy Lines&lt;/a&gt; telling us about &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeschool.io/&quot;&gt;Node School&lt;/a&gt;, and gauging interest for a future event.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-very-excited-to-be-part-of-javascriptnbspcoderetreathttpjscoderetreatcom2&quot;&gt;We’re very excited to be part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jscoderetreat.com/2/&quot;&gt;JavaScript CodeRetreat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;well&quot; id=&quot;hello-attendees&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Thanks for making it a success!&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first Oxford JS code retreat went really well in spite of a very early start. Pastries, coffee and burritos flowed, and we had some good discussions in the retrospectives and afterwards in the pub.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here are a few links from the day:
  &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/spikeheap/sets/72157644679033713/&quot;&gt;Photos from the day on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/spikeheap/javascript-code-retreat-oxford-may-2014&quot;&gt;The slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Y8P3KC2&quot;&gt;A survey for attendees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jscoderetreat.com/2/&quot;&gt;The session list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tddbin.com&quot;&gt;TDDBin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We're really excited about the possibility for variations of the code retreat theme, in particular:
  &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mixing up Python, Ruby &amp;amp; Javascript developers for a cultural exchange&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Focus on levelling-up JS: less focus on TDD, instead constrain the approach differently for each session to use 'the best bits' of JS&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Focus on functional programming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  If you're excited too or have ideas for how we could make it better, let us know!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Write better code, eat better food&amp;hellip; The JavaScript code retreat is a chance to hone your programming skills without the pressure of Getting Things Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jscoderetreat.com/2/&quot;&gt;JS Code Retreat&lt;/a&gt; is a day of pair-programming around a common programming challenge. Over 5 to 6 45-minute programming sessions you’ll get to work with a variety of people and work on improving your day-to-day coding, whether it’s TDD, DRY, naming, or whatever. At the end of each session we’ll regroup and share what we’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a nice introduction to code retreat and why it’s a great idea, &lt;a href=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/18955165?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot;&gt;check out this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-i-need-to-bring&quot;&gt;What do I need to bring?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just your good self and a laptop. If you’ve got a ready-to-go environment all the better, but if not we’d recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tddbin.com/&quot;&gt;TDDBin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll provide drinks and lunch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-does-it-cost&quot;&gt;How much does it cost?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take payment in fun, effort and brainpower. There is no entry fee, you just need to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat/attendees/&quot;&gt;RSVP on Lanyrd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where&quot;&gt;Where?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be meeting at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/&quot;&gt;White October&lt;/a&gt; to kick off coding at 8.30AM. Although that’s pretty early for a Saturday, we’re sychronising with groups from Cologne, Munich and Barcelona (so far). The upside is that it’s early enough for pastries!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we ask is that if you can’t make it you &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat/attendees/&quot;&gt;update your RSVP&lt;/a&gt; so we can get that space to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;that-sounds-great-how-can-i-help&quot;&gt;That sounds great, how can I help?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment we’d be really grateful for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsorship!&lt;/strong&gt; Help us provide codefuel to keep the creative juices flowing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help on the day.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s plenty of setting up and clearing down, as well as keeping the day running smoothly. Get in touch if you’re keen to help out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread the word.&lt;/strong&gt; Most important of all, shout it from the rooftops (or just use Twitter…).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haybrook.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Haybrook IT Resourcing&lt;/a&gt; have kindly sponsored breakfast pastries and lunch. Be sure to chat to Sarah over coffee before the event and say how great the food is!
We also have a JetBrains WebStorm license to give away - we’ll pick a winner from the attendees on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that wasn’t enough, we’ve got a number of 10% discount codes for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://2014.jsday.it/&quot;&gt;JSDay conference in Verona&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-were-back-hellipon-a-tuesday&quot;&gt;And we’re back! …on a TUESDAY!?!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;This month we're talking about getting our code running in the real world. Come along to find out how to deploy apps with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;heroku&lt;/a&gt; and how continuous deployment can help you build software faster and with less stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;node--heroku--unrealistic-time-constraints&quot;&gt;Node + Heroku + Unrealistic time constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;with-pete-west-smalla-hrefhttpstwittercomintentuserscreennamepeterjwestpeterjwestasmall&quot;&gt;with Pete West &lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=peterjwest&quot;&gt;@peterjwest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can you build and deploy a site in 5 minutes from scratch?
This will be a live code session where I try to do node and heroku at speed, and explain it at the same time.
May well be a codetastrophe, heckling encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete did a great job of deploying &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsox.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;jsox.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt; in (slightly over) 10 minutes.  He covered &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://npmjs.org&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com/&quot;&gt;express&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jade-lang.com/&quot;&gt;jade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bower.io/&quot;&gt;bower&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;continuous-deployment-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-failed-build&quot;&gt;Continuous Deployment or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Failed Build&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;caption&gt;&lt;small&gt;This photo is the talk description - we think that might be a good thing&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roy gave an awesome overview of his continous deployment process, his slides are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/hiltswaltfb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cancelled&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Bring yOur Own hYperlink Along&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;with Everyone!&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This worked pretty well last time, so we'll do it again!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We all bring a link to js-based project/post/anything that you find interesting and we'll have a quick chat about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weve-cancelled-booya-because-theres-a-github-drinkup-in-townhttpsgithubcomblog1809-github-drinkup-in-oxford-ukhellip&quot;&gt;We’ve cancelled BOOYA because there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1809-github-drinkup-in-oxford-uk&quot;&gt;GITHUB DRINKUP IN TOWN&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…If we start promptly at 7.30, and hold Pete to his unrealistic time constraints. We’ll have plenty of time to make it across town for the drink up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if this is the first you’ve heard about the drink up; you totally need to come along with us - it’s the polite thing to do! (and, it’s the &lt;a href=&quot;/rules.html&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, we’ll be meeting at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/&quot;&gt;White October&lt;/a&gt; at 7.30PM - we’d appreciate if you &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-march&quot;&gt;attend on lanyrd&lt;/a&gt; (it lets us know how many drinks and snacks to get in!).&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://jsoxford.com/2013/december</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Join us for the last meetup of 2013 where we'll be talking about using streams in node and chattting about some new JS Projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;indestructible-twitter-streams-with-node&quot;&gt;Indestructible twitter streams with node&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;by-benhttpbenjaminbenbencom-smalla-hrefhttpstwittercomintentuserscreennamebenjaminbenbenbenjaminbenbenasmall&quot;&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://benjaminbenben.com&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=benjaminbenben&quot;&gt;@benjaminbenben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The twitter streaming apis are totally fun and super awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’ll cover the (surprisingly detailed) data that we can get from the streams, and some of the challenges that we have to face to maintain a connection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’ll delve into the node stream API - and how we can use this to abstract a robust interface to the twitter apis that can survive network failures, stale connections and modifying query parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then we’ll talk about some of the awesome projects/hacks that we can do when we are able to dynamically alter parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;slideframe&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bring-your-own-hyperlink-along---booya&quot;&gt;Bring yOur Own hYperlink Along - BOOYA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;by-everyone&quot;&gt;by Everyone!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to try a new type of session, bring a few links to js-based projects that you find interesting and we’ll go through them and have a quick chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if you don’t know anything about the project, just anything that you find interesting or cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nodecopters are cool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you want to do complex calculations based on the transforms of elements, you might be better using webGL (counter argument: have you used webGL?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Went over why &lt;code&gt;[1,2,3].map(parseInt)&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;[1, NaN, NaN]&lt;/code&gt;, talked about dependency management for other languages and how projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://rails-assets.org/&quot;&gt;rails-assets&lt;/a&gt; can allow cross dependency integration. Touched briefly on PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;None of us actively/formally use fixtures in our JS projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;every-javascript-project-you-should-be-looking-intohttpwwwjavascriptoocom-via-jopottshttpstwittercomintentuserscreennamejopotts&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javascriptoo.com/&quot;&gt;Every javascript project you should be looking into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jopotts&quot;&gt;@jopotts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We liked how the library examples load in the same site and wondered if the projects were ordered by reverse popularity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jopotts&quot;&gt;@jopotts&lt;/a&gt; said he would have chosen &lt;a href=&quot;http://ejohn.org/blog/node-js-stream-playground/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; if he’d actually thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;For the night before &lt;a href=&quot;http://allyourbaseconf.com&quot;&gt;All Your Base&lt;/a&gt; we're teaming up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=oxfordpython&quot;&gt;Oxford&amp;nbsp;Python&lt;/a&gt; for a data-based&lt;sup&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;pun intended&quot;&gt;*&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; super-mega-meetup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note - this event &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; be at our usual venue, but at &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com/venues/oxford/vchz/&quot;&gt;Oxford University IT Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;D3 (Data-Driven Documents) is the world-conquering Javascript library for building beautiful data visualizations. It’s the sixth most starred repo on GitHub, and it’s taking over the universe.
If you’re new to D3, I’ll take you through the basics. If you’re already a fan, I’ll show you ten things you didn’t know you could do in D3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mobile Oxford is a web application for people living in and around Oxford developed by the University.
This talk will discuss the technical aspects of developing a generic HTTP API for use throughout the University (and beyond!) along with the JavaScript client for Mobile Oxford itself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;This month we have a special speaker coming to talk about cross platform automated testing your JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appium-javascript-powered-mobile-automation-smallby-a-hrefhttpwwwjonathanlippscomjonathan-lippsasmall&quot;&gt;Appium: Javascript-powered Mobile Automation &lt;small&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonathanlipps.com/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Lipps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://appium.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/appium-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Appium&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://appium.io/&quot;&gt;Appium&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source cross-platform mobile automation tool built in Node.js. The source and community are online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/appium/appium&quot;&gt;https://github.com/appium/appium&lt;/a&gt;. Appium’s interesting to JS devs for a number of reasons, not least because of the pressing need for better automation and CI tools in the mobile space in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Lipps has been making things out of code as long as he can remember.  He currently works as a Senior Software Developer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://saucelabs.com/&quot;&gt;Sauce Labs&lt;/a&gt;, which enables him to write code for various open-source projects, like Appium (for which he’s the primary architect and contributor). Jonathan has worked as a programmer in the startup world on and off for over a decade, and given talks on software development at conferences around the world, but is also passionate about academic discussion. Jonathan has master’s degrees in philosophy and linguistics, from Stanford and Oxford respectively. Living in San Francisco, he’s an avid homebrewer, rock climber, and writer on topics he considers vital, like the relationship of technology to what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;&amp;hellip;And we're back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long summer break,  though we’ve got a nice range of talks for a welcome back JSOxford&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started-with-nodejs-smallby-a-hrefhttpsskinofstarscomkevin-carmodyasmall&quot;&gt;Getting started with Node.js &lt;small&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;https://skinofstars.com&quot;&gt;Kevin Carmody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will help you get started with server-side JavaScript in Node.js. It’ll show you how to get setup, start adding packages, communicate with 3rd party services and persisting data to a simple document store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hands-on-phantomjs-smallby-a-hrefhttpbenjaminbenbencomben-foxallasmall&quot;&gt;Hands on PhantomJS &lt;small&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://benjaminbenben.com&quot;&gt;Ben Foxall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked about “Serving websites to websites with PhantomJS” at the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://oxford.geeknights.net/ogn32/&quot;&gt;Oxford Geek Night&lt;/a&gt;.  This is going to be a more practical session - I’ll go through creating a PhantomJS script, setting up the web server and deploying your service to heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-a-large-node-project-ghost-smallby-a-hrefhttpstwittercomjavorszkygabor-javorszkyasmall&quot;&gt;Working with a large node project: Ghost &lt;small&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/javorszky&quot;&gt;Gabor Javorszky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will talk about how developing a huge project in node works for us. There are currently about 15 people collaborating on the same codebase from the US to Australia. What are the logistics of it, how is the codebase structured, and what are some interesting gotchas we have managed to run into along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attend on &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com/2013/jsoxford/&quot;&gt;- lanyrd&lt;/a&gt; (so we know how much beer to get in)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;This month we have a selection of talks from our members &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyrd.com/2013/jsoxford-may/&quot;&gt;- lanyrd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, come to &lt;a href=&quot;http://whiteoctober.co.uk&quot;&gt;White October&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?daddr=White+October,+The+Gallery,+54+Marston+St,+Oxford+OX4+1LF&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=CR9NIctTj74FFcuaFQMdEBXt_yGk2w2z4TU66g&amp;amp;gl=GB&amp;amp;t=v&amp;amp;z=16&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;) for 7.30 - we’ll aim to start the talks by 7.45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=javorszky&quot;&gt;Gabor Javorszky&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Deploying with GruntJS&lt;/strong&gt; - I was introduced to Grunt.js a short while ago. Since then, I’ve gotten rid of a ton of apps and settings: a) Codekit b) SFTP plugin on Sublime. Basically, all the tasks you would need to do under one roof living in one configuration file at the end of one command. I’ll show what I use it for, and how I got there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=chvck&quot;&gt;Charles Dixon&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;A quick introduction to nosql&lt;/strong&gt; - Part 1 of 3.  In this talk we’ll cover why maybe we don’t want to use a relational DB for some things and we’ll look at the 4 “main” types of nosql databases currently in use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=benjaminbenben&quot;&gt;Ben Foxall&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Win Win communication&lt;/strong&gt; -
Experiences on the web don’t have to be constrained to a single browser window: we’ll go over some of the technologies that allow data to be shared across multiple windows or devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jermolene&quot;&gt;Jeremy Ruston&lt;/a&gt; gave us a fantastic overview TiddlyWiki and his 25 year reboot project &lt;a href=&quot;http://five.tiddlywiki.com&quot;&gt;TiddlyWiki5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;John told us about kinetic text and how he’s been building a demo with html/css/js.&lt;/li&gt;
