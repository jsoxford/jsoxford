<p class="lead">Write better code to a backdrop of pastries and burritos&hellip; the Code Retreat is a chance to hone your programming skills without the pressure of Getting Things Done.</p>

Following on from the success of the JavaScript Code Retreat in May we're excited to be running the 2nd Oxford Code Retreat, and this time it's Super-Mega! Want to get hone your JavaScript, Ruby or Python? Code Retreat is for you! This time we're shifting the focus from TDD to functional and object-oriented techniques.

#### What is it?

Code Retreat is a day of pair-programming around a common challenge. Over five 45-minute sessions you'll get to work with a variety of people to improve your day-to-day coding. At the end of each session we'll regroup and share what we've learned.

For a nice introduction to code retreat and why it's a great idea, [check out this video](http://player.vimeo.com/video/18955165?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0).
